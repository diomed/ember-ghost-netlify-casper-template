What is life but a teardrop in the eye of infinity?  
Together, we lived, we laughed, we loved.   
But you left me and now, I walk this wilderness alone.  
What use is a cop with a broken heart?   
Without you, I’m nothing… nothing…nothing…nothing…nothing…nothing…nothing. NOTHING.  
The Romans lit fires in the skulls of their dead so they might forget their past.   
Wherever I look, I’m reminded our relationship is dead. Nothing.

It’s Winter now and the seeds of love lie deep within me.  
Will Spring ever come? I thought by now I’d have met another,   
but it was not to be. But I can show the world that you were once mine.   
I can relive our time together. Those precious memories that I yearn to forget.   
Time slips through my fingers like sand.   
The fires of our love have burnt out and now there is nothing.   
Nothing but a sky black with ashes.

I won’t forget you, your kisses like soft fruit.   
Your laughter bursting into daylight like silver.   
Your smile like the curl of the sickle moon in the night sky.  
Your luminous beauty, your goodness, your patience.  
How you hung on my every word. You are now in the arms of another.   
Who is he, this man? Does he have poise? Does he have grace?   
Is he a lover or a fighter? What powers does he have over you?   
Do your eyes dance like fireflies in the night when he comes to you?  
Does your body soften as your lips shape his name?

I can’t believe you’ve been so selfish. You are consumed by love.  
How does he cast a spell over you? Enchant you, beguile you?    
Why did you shut me out? I struggle to survive.  
When I look back on the darkest moments of our history,  
I knew that we would part and that now I must let you go.   
We will know a deeper, surer love. It begins fleetingly,    
but it deepens and endures. It grows amidst all the strangeness of life.   
It is a beauty we can always depend on.  
It is the beauty of friendship.
