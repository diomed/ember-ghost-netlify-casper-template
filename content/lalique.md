Hey! Skeet - Skeet - Scripity Script Screech screech!!


I remember when I was 12 years old I would always play this video walking home from school through the woods. It gives me nostalgia just thinking about it. The vivid yellow rays from the sun would pierce through the lush green canopy as the trees would sway in the warm wind. As I would take in the visuals i’d play this video on repeat on my iPhone 4 listening to that subtle vocal harmony and piercing guitar riff as if I was addicted to it. This song always made me feel happy to be free from school and now it only fills me with pure N O S T A L G I A. I’m 18 now, in a college hundreds of miles from those beautiful woods stressed as can be but still vibing to this video on my iPhone 7.

That's a nice thought....for an idiot to have

“My dreams?” a woman in Latvia asked. “That’s something very private, isn’t it?”
“It’s OK,” I assured her. “I’m a professional, you see. So it’s rather like undressing for a doctor’s exam. Strictly business.”
“Actually,” she countered, “I’m a stripper, so I have no problem taking off my clothes. But my dreams? That’s very different.”

 Electrolytes are the salts in the blood – mostly sodium, potassium, chloride and calcium. 
 If levels become too high or too low, your body has a way of alerting you, by making your 
 heart stop or putting you in a coma. It’s clever like that.

 Recreate the experience for yourself by tying your shoelaces with chopsticks. With your eyes closed. In space.

Broken
I was not born a poet.
I was broken into one.

 “But with the freedom came sadness.” 

“I've learned that intelligence alone doesn't mean a damned thing. 
Here in your university, intelligence, education, knowledge, have all become great idols. 
But I know now there's one thing you've all overlooked: intelligence and education that 
hasn't been tempered by human affection isn't worth a damn.”
― Daniel Keyes, Flowers for Algernon 
No one had spoken of hope. The feeling was of living death-or worse, of never having been fully alive and knowing. 
Souls withered from the beginning, and doomed to stare into the time and space of every day.

"If that is your understanding of the current agreement, 
we need go revisit the language so that your expectation 
levels can be set more appropriately."

Forlorn


There is just nothing good to say about forlorn. Desolate or dreary; unhappy or miserable . . . ." 
The meaning draws a pretty bleak picture. You're blue, down in the dumps, woebegone. 
That's a forlorn feeling, for sure.

## Full bleed images


![walking](https://casper.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/walking.jpg#full)

which is styled with...

```
img[src$="#full"] {
    max-width: 100vw;
}
```

This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.


## Reference lists

Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.


## Full HTML

Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cniqsc9QfDo?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
