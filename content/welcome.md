Kolajnu vidim sjajno zanesenu, 
ljubljeno dijete, baš o tvome vratu.



### There are a few things that you should know up-front:

1. Ember Ghost is designed to be a static site version of the amazing [Ghost blogging platform](https://ghost.org/)

1. Ember Ghost is designed for developers who know how to deploy a satic site (folder of html files and assets) using something like S3 or even just on NGINX.

1. If you are slightly less tech savvy or if you want to manage your blog outside of just a set of files in a git repo we highly recommend signing up for [Ghost](https://ghost.org/pricing/)

### Quick Start

```
Neki bi se možda pitali kako to dva čovjeka smatraju jedan drugoga za
stare prijatelje iako se poznaju samo četiri godine; međutim, trajanje
prijateljstva nikada se ne mjeri samo protokom vremena. Njih dvojica bi se
osjećali kao stari prijatelji i da su se sreli tek koji sat ranije. 
To je donekle bilo zato što su bili srodne duše.

```

It will ask you if you want to update the `index.html` file and you should say yes 👍

If you want to see the blog system running on your local machine just run `npm start` and you will
be able to navigate to  [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to see the blog in action.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [editing files with Ember Ghost](/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!
